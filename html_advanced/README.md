# Webpage Implementation from Designer File

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing the HTML structure of a webpage based on a designer file in Figma. The goal is to build a semantic HTML layout, with no CSS styling involved. This is the first step in the project, focusing purely on the HTML structure.

## Instructions

1. **Figma Designer File**: 
   - Access the design in Figma
   - Duplicate the file to your drafts to access the full design details.
   
2. **Fonts**: 
   - Make sure to install the fonts **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin Cycle OT** if they are missing from your system.

3. **HTML Structure**:
   - Focus only on creating the HTML structure based on the Figma design.
   - Ensure semantic HTML tags are used for better accessibility and structure.

4. **Page Sections**:
   - Implement the following sections as per the Figma design:
     - Header
     - Navigation
     - Main content area
     - Footer

5. **Assets**:
   - All images, fonts, or other assets can be found in the Figma file. Ensure you link them correctly in your project.

6. **Accessibility**:
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) and ensure proper labeling for accessibility.
   - Add alt attributes to images and labels to forms where applicable.

7. **Validation**:
   - After completing the HTML, validate the structure using the W3C HTML validator to ensure there are no errors.


## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the page structure.

## Next Steps

Once the HTML structure is complete, the next step will be adding CSS to style the page as per the Figma design.
