# CSS Advanced Project

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following concepts related to CSS:

### General Concepts:
- **What is CSS?**  
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of a webpage.

- **How to add style to an element?**  
  Styles can be added to HTML elements using inline styles, internal stylesheets (within the `<style>` tag), or external stylesheets (using the `link` tag).

- **What is a class?**  
  A class is an attribute in HTML used to group elements and apply the same styles to multiple elements. CSS selectors can target these class names to apply specific styles to them.

- **What is a selector?**  
  A selector is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements. CSS selectors can target elements based on their ID, class, type, attributes, or pseudo-classes.

- **How to compute CSS Specificity Value?**  
  CSS specificity determines which style rules are applied to an element when multiple rules match it. It is calculated based on the number of IDs, classes, and elements in the selector.

- **What are Box properties in CSS?**  
  Box properties refer to the box model that describes how elements are displayed, including content, padding, border, and margin. These properties control the element's size and positioning.

- **How does the browser load a webpage?**  
  When a browser loads a webpage, it first requests the HTML file, then parses and renders it. After that, it loads associated resources like CSS files, images, and JavaScript. The browser processes the CSS and applies styles to elements, displaying the page to the user.
